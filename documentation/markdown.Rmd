STATS MCSETS CONVERT Extension Command
======================================


Convert a multiple category set into a multiple dichotomy set.

STATS MCSETS CONVERT  
MCSET=*mcset*^&#42;  
VARPREFIX=*string*^&#42;  
SETNAME=*setname*^&#42;

/HELP

^&#42; Required  
^&#42;&#42; Default

/HELP displays this text and does nothing else.

Example:
```
STATS MCSET CONVERT MCSET = $mcset1 VARPREFIX=set1 SETNAME=$fromset1.
```

This procedure converts a multiple category set into a multiple dichotomy set.
It generates a dichotomous variable for each value found in the variables
that define the MC set and assigns the value labels, if any, taken from the
first variable in the set as the variable labels of the new variables.

This may be useful in order to use the
STATS CATEGORY ORDER extension command for working with CTABLES.

Existing variables are overwritten, but if there is a type conflict,
an error will be generated.

**MCSET** is a multiple category set to convert to a multiple dichotomy set.

**VARPREFIX** specifies text that will be prepended to the names of the generated
names that form the output.  The generated names have the form
`prefix_nn`
where nn is a number. They may overwrite an existing variable.

**SETNAME** is the name for the output multiple dichotomy set.
